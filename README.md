# double_sided_scan_merger
Script to merge two PDF files: one containing all odd pages of a scan, one containing all even pages of a scan in reverse order.

This script supports converting scans that were generated by a simplex scanner with automatic document feeder (ADF) to duplex scans. The supported workflow is as follows:
1. Generate a PDF that contains scans of all odd pages with an alpha-numeric filename, e. g. prefixXXXXXX.pdf
2. Generate a PDF that contains scans of all even pages in reverse order (by scanning the document with the last even page first) with an alpha-numeric filename, e. g. prefixYYYYYY.pdf (where XXXXXX < YYYYYY < ZZZZZZ)
3. Call: python double_sided_scan_merger.py source_dir destination_dir. A new file named with the conversion date time stamp is generated in destination_dir that contains all odd and even pages in the correct order.
